What are you doing to stand out from other agents? Today I'll share why client video testimonials are so important, and how easy they are to add to your marketing efforts. So many agents shy away from video or think that none of their clients would be willing. That’s just not true.

**Client video testimonials are so important because you’re showing evidence of success.** You could make as many flyers or posts saying how great you are as you want, but at the end of the day, a simple video testimonial will give you tons more exposure and credibility. I’ve seen it make a difference time and time again.

It’s easy to do too. Think of four or five questions you want to ask your client, like how was their experience, what did they love about the process, etc. Have them answer those questions in front of a videographer who can do the recording for you, and edit it. Finally, you can send it out to every prospect you have.&nbsp;

It’s a huge gain for a small investment. If you want to see a few examples, follow [this link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SiYcCjS59U8&amp;list=PL6A8okbO16FWADWjI1dPrUTRfRhm54YDX){: target="_blank" rel="noopener"} and watch our client testimonials. Also, if you have any questions, just call or email me. I’d love to help.
