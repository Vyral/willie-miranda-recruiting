If you’re not having great results with internet leads, you need to follow up more. Don't be a one-and-done, hit-and-run agent. Internet leads are often down-the-road leads, and you have to follow up with them to stay top of mind. Today I’ll talk about the process I use to stay in touch with these leads.

Did you know that 80% of sales are made on the fifth to 12th contact, and 48% of agents don't even call leads? A slightly higher percentage make one phone call and never call again. **We have a 3-4-12 follow-up system in place, and it's worked very well over the years.&nbsp;**

As soon as you get a lead, call them. Continue by following up on that call the next day. You want to reach out to that lead at least three times. If you don't get a hold of them at first, their priority might not be to buy right now. Start giving them a call once per week for the next four weeks. If you still don't get a hold of that person, just reach out to them once per month.

That adds up to 19 touches over 13 months. You're going to have a much better follow-up rate because you're going to catch them down the road when they're ready to enter the market. I hope this information helped you.

If you have questions about this follow-up method or anything else, don’t hesitate to reach out to me by phone or email. I look forward to hearing from you.
