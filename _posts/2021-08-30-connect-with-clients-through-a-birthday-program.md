What are you doing to stay in the front of your clients’ minds? You want to make sure you are the first person they call when they have a real estate question, but how? Today I’ll share one easy and free way you can deepen your relationships with your clients.

The brilliance of my solution comes from its simplicity. Just **set up a yearly birthday program**. It works like this: whenever you help someone with a real estate transaction, make sure you get your client’s date of birth. Then, set up a reminder in your calendar and make sure it recurs every year.

So you know all your clients’ birthdays, but now what? **The easiest thing to do is give them a call and say happy birthday**. A lot of agents tell me it’s awkward having small talk with their clients, but when it’s their birthday you already have something to talk about. It doesn’t need to be a 30-minute conversation. A simple “Happy birthday” and “How are you?” are all you need.

If you don’t have time for a phone call on their birthday, **shoot them a quick video**. Once again, it doesn’t need to be long. You aren’t trying to film *Titanic*; you just want them to know you were thinking of them. If you film a video for your client, you’d be surprised how much it means to them. They might get tons of messages on Facebook, but your video will stand out.

You’ll also want to **send them a birthday card**. Something short, sweet, and to the point is all you need. It doesn't need to be super personal either, so you can bulk order cards if you want to. **I also recommend leaving something like a scratch-off lottery ticket with the card**. They only cost a dollar or two, but it’s the act of giving that your client will remember.

**Between the card, the video, the ticket, and the phone call, you are looking at two or three dollars per birthday**. It means a lot to people too. You’d be surprised how many people comment on how much they appreciate the gesture. If you have any questions about today’s topic or anything else related to real estate, please reach out to me. I am always willing to help.
