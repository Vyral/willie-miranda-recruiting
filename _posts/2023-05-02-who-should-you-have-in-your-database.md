I recently attended a training class highlighting the importance of building a database for real estate agents. The trainer suggested that every agent, especially those new to the business, start with Project 100. This involves adding 100 people to your database, including those who know you, those you know, and those who trust you. However, there seems to be some confusion among agents about who should be included in their database. Many believe that only those who are likely to buy or sell in the near future should be added.

This misconception can limit the growth of an agent's database and, in turn, their business. According to the trainer, the average person knows around 285 people. **So, by adding just 100 people to your database, you could potentially be in front of 28,500 people.** This is an enormous opportunity for agents to establish themselves as experts in the field by providing value to their database, such as helpful information and videos, and staying top of mind.

The key is not to limit yourself to only those who are looking to buy or sell soon. Instead, think about all the people you know, including family members, friends, and church acquaintances. Even if they may not seem like potential clients now, they could be in the future or could refer others to you.

By continuously expanding your database, you can turn Project 100 into Project 200, Project 300, and beyond. **As your database grows, so does your business.** It's important to remember that your database is your most valuable asset as a real estate agent. Without it, you don't have a business.

So, don't wait to start building your database. Begin with Project 100 and keep adding to it. With consistent effort and value-driven content, you can establish yourself as an expert in the field and position yourself for success.
