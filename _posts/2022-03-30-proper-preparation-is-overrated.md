“Don’t wait until you’re ready to start to do something.” I heard this message from a great speaker at the top real estate conference in the world here in Las Vegas. He said that so many people in so many businesses don’t realize that **you don’t have to wait until you’re fully ready to get started.&nbsp;**

The key to success is innovation, and I thought about a lot of agents who get in the business, get their license, and think the phone is going to ring off the hook. It’s not going to happen. You have to be proactive, make calls, and find leads. If I want to shoot a video or write a blog, do I need to shower, shave, and put on my suit? If you look at me in the video above, you can see that the answer is no.

Maybe for you, it’s an activity like making calls. Just take the list you have and start calling. You don’t have to be perfect on your scripts from the very first call. **Another way to stand out and be innovative is to do the opposite of what others are doing**. There are a ton of different ways to do this in real estate.

Don't wait to get started bringing in business until you’re “ready.” Get started today.&nbsp;

If you have questions for me about getting started or anything else related to the real estate business, don’t hesitate to reach out via phone or email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
