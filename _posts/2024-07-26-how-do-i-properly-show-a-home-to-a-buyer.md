In the wake of the NAR settlement, buyer’s agents are in a tough position. What will your relationship with buyers look like going forward, and how can you ensure a steady income in this new environment?

In my opinion, demonstrating value and building trust with your clients is more important now than ever. Buyers want to work with someone they trust to protect their interests, and you need to establish that trust as quickly as possible. The truth is that most pitches from real estate agents to buyers are the same—to stand out from the crowd, you need to go a step beyond. That’s why today, I’m sharing three tips to help you nail your showings and establish real trust quickly with clients:

**1\. Frame the relationship as a two-way street.** Make it clear to your clients that you don’t just work with anyone. Instead, emphasize that you’re looking for clients who are serious about doing what it takes to get a great deal in this tough market. This accomplishes two things: First, you won’t waste your time with clients who might give up on buying a home after weeks of effort. Second, you’ll demonstrate to your clients that you will be active in the home-buying process. You won’t be an agent who passively helps out when needed; you’ll be a trusted professional actively helping them achieve their goals. This establishes trust upfront while communicating what type of relationship your client is in for.

**2\. Audition at the showing.** The last thing buyers want from their agent is someone pushy or overly “salesy.” Project confidence and don’t come across as desperate. Due to higher interest rates and home prices, buyers have a lot of anxiety about the housing market right now. Let them know that you can be their guide, and they’ll be more likely to put your trust in you for the showing and beyond.

**3\. Don’t be afraid to point out flaws.** Instead of constantly trying to highlight the home’s features, give them space. Don’t be afraid to mention any issues you notice in the home, like minor repair issues. Right now, buyers don’t have a lot of cash for repairs after purchasing a home since they want to put as much money down and lower their monthly payments. Demonstrate to your clients that you are there to protect their interests, and they’ll trust you enough to work with you long-term.

At the end of the day, be the agent you would want to have as a first-time homebuyer. This is how I strive to run my team: By creating the environment I would want to be in. If you’re curious about what we do for our agents or how we run things, just give us a call or send us an email. We’d love to answer any questions you may have.
