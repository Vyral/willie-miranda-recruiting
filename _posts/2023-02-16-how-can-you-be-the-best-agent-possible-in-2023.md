I recently watched an interview with one of the greatest college football coaches of all time, Nick Saban, and he said something very interesting. According to him, everyone can make five different kinds of choices: bad, average, good, excellent, and elite. If you want to be the best, you need to make excellent and elite choices on a regular basis. Today I want to talk about how this idea applies to real estate and how you can make better choices to grow your business.&nbsp;
