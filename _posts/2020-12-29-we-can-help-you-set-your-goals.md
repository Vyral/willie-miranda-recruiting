<center><em>Need help planning your business&rsquo;s goals for 2021?</em></center>

<br>Now that we’re near the end of 2020, we plan to head into 2021 with a more positive mindset. That’s just one of our many goals—what are yours? When it comes to goal-planning, we find that there are three types of agents in the market:

* Agents who write down their goals for the year and already have a plan in place to make them happen.
* Agents who won’t write down their goals and never will.
* Agents who want to write down their goals but can’t due to a sort of writer’s block.

To that last group of agents, I say that maybe planning out a whole year is a bit too much; **perhaps you should read “The 12-Week Year” by Brian Moran**. The book discusses the importance of planning your goals in 12-week sprints versus writing down annual goals. Many people have found this strategy to be more effective.

With that in mind, **I’m offering you a free, 30-minute business strategy call**. No matter where you are, whether you’re planning goals or just need to tweak them a little, I’d be more than happy to help you. <u><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://ultimaterealestatesuccessblueprint.com/strategy-call">Click here</a></u> to sign up for your free call, and we’ll reach out to you to set up a time.
