If you didn’t write down any goals for 2021 or haven’t looked at the ones you did set at the beginning of the year, here are four goal categories I recommend refocusing on:

**1\. Health**. The reason I mention this goal category is that I know so many people are affected differently by it. Due to COVID, a lot of people stopped going to the gym and working out, and they may be feeling a little unhealthy or not as good about themselves lately. Others want to get back on a routine but haven’t done so yet. Now that things are opening back up and more vaccinations are being distributed, more people want to refocus on their health. This is important because without health it’s hard to refocus on your other goals. Pick one activity under this&nbsp; category (going to the gym, starting a diet, losing a few COVID pounds, etc.) and stick to it.

**2\. Family**. Start reconnecting with your family. Over the past year, both of my daughters stayed with my wife and I for about six months, and it was great being able to spend that extra time with them. A lot of families out there have relatives they were forced to isolate from due to COVID, though. I’ve spoken with people who haven’t seen their parents and/or grandparents for over a year. It’s important to reconnect with your family because you want to have as much of a work/life balance as possible.

**3\. Personal goals**. Perhaps this can mean redefining your “why.” What motivates you to get out of bed each morning? Recalibrating this motivation can give you the energy you need to achieve on a personal level. Pick one personal goal and start with why you’re in the real estate business, whether it’s because of the money or having that time and organization back on a personal level.

**4\. Business goals**. This is the golden goose—we need to get the business side of things in check. I know a lot of people who had their best year ever in 2020, but that was a COVID year. This year we all need to focus on the fundamentals and dial into what drives our business. Which activities will produce the results you want? Stay focused on the right activities and set business goals that will get you to where you want to go.

Share these goal categories with a friend, partner, or someone you trust to keep you accountable. Also, read them to yourself at least once a week (or every day, if you can). Write them down and place them in areas where you’re constantly looking so you don’t forget about them.

If you have questions about this topic or there’s anything else I can help you with, don’t hesitate to reach out to me. I’d love to speak with you.
