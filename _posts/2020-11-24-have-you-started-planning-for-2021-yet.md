<center><em>These eight areas are where you should be setting your goals for 2021.</em></center>

<br>As we approach the end of the year, it’s the time where a lot of agents are setting their goals for 2021. I was talking to one of my agents yesterday about goal-setting. They were online looking at all these YouTube videos and reading lots of booklets, but that wasn’t needed. The truth is that a confused mind often does nothing.

Instead, I shared a very simple technique and strategy that I’ve used for several years to set my goals each year. It focuses on setting goals in eight different areas of your life, and I want to go through each one with you today.

**Feel free to follow along in the video above to see my message in its entirety, or use these timestamps to skip ahead to various sections at your leisure:**

1:40 — Material possession goals

2:05 — Business and career goals

2:50 — Personal lifestyle goals

3:25 — Relationship goals

4:00 — Family and friend goals

4:45 — Health goals

5:25 — Spiritual/gratitude goals

6:21 — Contribution goals

7:05 — Wrapping things up

If you have questions for me about any of these areas or concerning the real estate business, don’t hesitate to reach out via phone or email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
