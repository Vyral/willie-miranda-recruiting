Do you have a pricing strategy that you discuss with sellers before listing their homes? I still see way too many agents overpricing homes, so I want to share two pricing strategies that have worked very well for me over the years.

**The first strategy is to price a home high**, which most agents already do. Let’s say you have a home worth $500,000. Many sellers and agents will price it at $525,000 or $550,000 and be willing to negotiate down.

The second strategy is to price the home at or below what it’s worth, and very few agents do this. However, my team and I find that the number of potential buyers will be greater if you price the home this way. With that same $500,000 home, you could price it at or lower than $500,000 and attract more buyers. **You’ll get multiple offers and ultimately sell for a higher price.**

If you have questions about these strategies, feel free to call or email me. I’d love to help.
