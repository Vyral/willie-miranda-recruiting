<br>Today I am sharing six very simple steps that top real estate professionals do, take to manage their time.

**1\. Plan your week**. If you don’t plan it, someone else will. I do this on Sunday evening with my wife and plan out the entire week for business, social, and family functions. Make sure that you have one calendar that you use.

**2\. Make a to-do list**. Mine is about nine pages long right now, from returning texts, voicemails, or emails to getting stuff done around the house.

**3\. Plan your day**. Take out your to-do list and prioritize it each day within your schedule. For example, I knew I had to sit down and go over a proposal for a client with another agent, so I time blocked that activity for one hour into my schedule on a day during the week. If I didn't put it in my schedule from my to-do list, I wouldn't have done it.

**4\. Control incoming calls**. It’s great to set a time for prospecting calls every day, but how often are those calls interrupted by personal ones? Let those incoming calls go to voicemail while you’re prospecting and let clients and friends know you’ll get back to them later. Don’t sacrifice or interrupt that critical prospecting time.

**5\. Schedule lead generation**. You have to schedule this for a minimum of two hours a day for five days a week. If you're a newer agent, you should probably double that. This is going to help you put business in your pipeline. Treat that time as listing appointments, even if not all of them are.

**6\. Take a day off**. It’s so important to schedule time off. You’re going to get burned out or sick if you work all day every day. There are some weeks where you won’t be able to do it, but make up for it by taking two days off the next week or a couple of half-days off.
