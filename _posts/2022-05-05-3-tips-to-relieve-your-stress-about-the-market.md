Is this market starting to stress you out a little bit? A lot of agents feel this way. Structure is the key to freedom in this hectic market, and today I’m going to show you why.&nbsp;

Now that business has started to pick up for the spring and summer, it’s more important than ever to have systems and structures to handle the uptick in business. **These are my three best tips if you’re feeling a bit stressed about the market these days:**

**1\. Make a to-do list.** Get everything you can out of your head. If you try to remember everything, you’re going to drop the ball. If you tell someone you’re going to do something, write it down somewhere. Put it on your phone, on a scrap of paper, etc.

**2\. Get a calendar.** Use a calendar consistently to prioritize your to-do list. You can’t manage time properly without a calendar. We can manage our focus, and using your calendar to block off activities will lead to less stress.

**3\. Plan for tomorrow today.** I can’t stress how important this is. Plan out your day, then let your subconscious mind start working on the next day. Then you wake up refreshed and ready to tackle your plan. You’ll have less stress with a concrete plan as well.

If you have any questions about handling the stress of this market or anything else related to the real estate business, don't hesitate to reach out via phone or email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
