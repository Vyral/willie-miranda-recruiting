<center><em>Accountability is very important when it comes to achieving your goals.</em></center>

<br>We’re well into November, which means it’s that time of year again to start setting goals for next year.

The real estate business operates on a 60- to 90-day cycle, so it’s important to plan your goals now, and the best way to do this is with accountability. Over the past couple of years, **I’ve maintained accountability on my team by putting together an accountability group**. This group, typically 12 to 15 people, recently began hosting accountability sessions via Zoom so we can complete what we call a ‘six-week sprint.’ We’ll meet once a week for the next six weeks to state the goals we want to meet for the next 12 months. We’ll also discuss what we need to do during these six weeks to launch our 12-month program.

Every time we start these six-week sprints, our agents get a ton of value from them. Last year, a couple of our agents had great starts to the first quarter, and a large part of their success was due to the accountability sessions they attended in October and November of the year prior. In these sessions, each agent goes over the goals they want to achieve in the next six weeks. Sometimes they’ll state their annual goals as well.

At the end of each session, we assign all agents an accountability partner. The agent and their partner then communicate every day to ensure they're taking the steps they need to take. When we meet the following week, everyone recaps which steps they took to achieve their goals. This could be building out a geographic farming campaign, social media campaign, or video campaign. Next week, everyone switches partners and the process starts all over again until the sprint is over.

**When you emphasize accountability and include your peers in this emphasis, you maximize your results**. This strategy has been very successful for my team. Not only will we finish 2020 strong, but we’ll start 2021 strong too.

As always, if you’d like to discuss today’s topic with me or have any questions I can answer, don’t hesitate to reach out to me. I’d love to speak with you.
