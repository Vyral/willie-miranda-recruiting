Our market can be tricky for buyers and sellers alike, so today I’ll be showing you how you can set expectations for your clients before helping them with their real estate journey.

First, it’s important to educate clients about what’s going on in the market and what they should prepare for. **For buyers, we need to let them know that this isn’t a good time to get a great deal on a home.** However, it’s still a great market for those who are motivated and looking to capitalize on low interest rates. A lot of agents have ended up with frustrated clients because they take them on multiple showings, let them put in lowball offers, and fail to let them know how tough the market can be. We’ve even been putting together presentations in order to educate buyers, discuss a timeline, and set goals.

**It’s also important to set expectations for sellers.** Many homeowners are hearing from friends, family members, and neighbors that they can get tens of thousands of dollars over asking price. If we look at the data, however, it’s simply not true. We walk our sellers through the numbers and show them that, although our market is hot, they can’t start out with a high listing price. In fact, it’s often better to start low or at market value and allow competition to push the price higher.

So, make sure to set expectations and be clear when working with your buyer and seller clients. If you have any questions or would like more information, feel free to reach out to me. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
