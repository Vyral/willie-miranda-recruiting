Everyone knows it’s important to be on time, but it’s probably even more important than you think. Today, I’ll share why being on time is crucial to your success.

Like most agents, I’ve always known that being on time is a good idea. However, I really began to focus on the idea when I read Dan Kennedy’s “No B.S. Time Management for Entrepreneurs.” It’s a great read, and in one of the early chapters, he talks about **the link between punctuality and integrity**. If you show up late to a meeting and you don’t even have the courtesy to call the person and let them know, how can they trust you to hold up your end of a deal?

I highly recommend Dan Kennedy’s book for real estate agents because I know a lot of us struggle with time management. There’s great advice all over the book, but it’s no coincidence that being on time is hammered home in one of the early chapters. Establishing integrity with a potential client is the basis for all further transactions. If you lose it, you’re out of luck.

Some sellers have been waiting to sell their homes for 20 or 30 years. **If you can’t show up punctually, it proves you don’t respect their time**. On a similar note, if you are visiting a client in their home, always ask them if they’d like you to take your shoes off. It’s a little thing, but it’s a sign of respect. People do business with people they know, like, and trust. If you drag mud all over their floor, they might know you, but they probably won’t like or trust you.
