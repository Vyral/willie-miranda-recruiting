A few of my fellow agents and I were recently discussing ways that we help our homebuyers get their offers accepted. Each of us had some different ideas about what works best, so today I’ll be sharing the three best tips we came up with:

**1\. Set expectations:** Additionally, agents should go over the contract and advise clients to make larger deposits as well as adjust inspection requirements.

**2\. Maintain a strong relationship with your client:** Reach out to your clients and find out what’s most important to them. You can put this in the offer and help strengthen it.

**3\. Send an email summary:** Use this email to summarize the offer’s greatest strengths. It’ll talk about the amount offered, the type of financing, inspections, and more. Do your best to keep everything in a single email with one attachment.

I’d like to thank my fellow agents for the great tips they shared. If you have any questions or would like more information about helping buyer clients win in today’s market, feel free to reach out to me. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
