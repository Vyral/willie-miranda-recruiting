A few of my fellow agents and I were recently discussing ways that help our homebuyers get their offers accepted. Each of us had some different ideas about what works best, so today I’ll be sharing the three best tips we came up with:

**1\. Set expectations:** Agents should go over the entire contract and advise their clients to make larger deposits or increase the threshold amount for inspections.

**2\. Maintain a good relationship with the listing agent:** Reach out to the listing agent to find out what is most important to the sellers. You can add this information into the offer to help strengthen it.

**3\. Send an email summary:** When sending your offer to the listing agent, summarize the offer’s greatest strengths in the email, such as, the amount offered, the type of financing, inspections, and more. Do your best to keep everything in a single PDF with one attachment.

I’d like to thank my fellow agents for the great tips they shared. If you have any questions or would like more information about helping buyer clients win in today’s market, feel free to reach out to me. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
