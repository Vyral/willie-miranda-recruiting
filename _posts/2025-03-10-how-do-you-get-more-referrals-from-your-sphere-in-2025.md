Spring is coming, and with it, the busiest real estate season of the year. But will your sphere be working for you? If you want consistent, high-quality referrals, you need a system for staying top-of-mind. Today, I’m sharing three simple yet powerful ways to stay connected, add value, and make sure your name is the first one people think of when they hear, ‘I’m thinking of buying or selling.

**1\. Leverage the spring market boom.** Spring is the real estate power season. Based on historical data from NAR, home sales typically increase by over 30% between March and June, and prices can rise by 3% to 5%, depending on the market. More transactions mean more opportunities for you—but only if your sphere knows how active the market is. Keep them informed by sending quick market updates, price trends, and “just sold” stories to maintain their interest. Use the “Fear of Missing Out” or FOMO to your advantage by reminding them that buyers are out in full force, making now the perfect time to make a move. The more engaged your sphere is, the more referrals they’ll send your way.

**2\. Offer seasonal value beyond real estate.** Here’s the truth: People don’t want to be sold to—they want to be helped. The best way to stay top of mind is by consistently providing value beyond the transaction. Instead of telling them how good the house is through your listing, show them the lifestyle that they can achieve living in your home. You can also create content and conversations around things like spring cleaning and home organization tips, de-winterizing and home maintenance checklists, and local spring events or community happenings. Leverage life events, too. Spring is full of milestones like graduations, weddings, and relocations, and these moments often trigger real estate decisions. Celebrate these milestones with your sphere while gently reminding them that you’re their go-to real estate expert. It’s not just about selling homes—it’s about building relationships that lead to referrals.

**3\. Refresh and reignite your social media.** If you’re not active on social media, you’re missing one of the biggest referral opportunities available today. In 2025, real estate agents who consistently use social media are generating 47% more high-quality leads, and an impressive 90% of buyers start their home search online. So, the question is, how do you refresh and reignite your social media presence? Start spring-cleaning your social media by updating your bio and contact info so people can easily reach you. Share success stories and just-listed/just-sold updates to showcase your activity. Don’t forget to engage with your audience—comment, like, and DM past clients and contacts to stay in their world. Staying visible on social media means staying top-of-mind when someone is ready to refer you.

Staying in touch with your sphere isn’t about luck—it’s about strategy. The agents who succeed in 2025 will be the ones who stay visible, add value, and engage their networks consistently. If you’re looking for more referral strategies, marketing ideas, or just want to brainstorm how to take your business to the next level, let’s connect! Feel free to reach out by phone, email, or DM—I’d love to help.
