If you’re like most real estate agents, your schedule is busy, busy, busy. However, is being busy actually the same thing as being productive? This time of year especially, I see a lot of agents who bury themselves in busy work because they don’t want to do the things that matter. If you’re stuck doing busywork instead of being productive, here are four things to focus on to get you back on track:

**1\. Lead generation.** Now is the time to double down on lead generation. Don’t hide behind answering friendly emails, grabbing lockboxes, or brainstorming social media posts. Leads are the lifeblood of your business, so they should be your first priority.&nbsp;

**2\. Listings.** Make sure you’re up to date on listing inventory in your area. For example, expired listings are a great way to find quality leads on short notice.&nbsp;

**3\. Working with buyers.** Buyers are back out there now that interest rates have adjusted. Pick up the phone and let people know about their options, like 2-1 buydowns.&nbsp;

**4\. Negotiating.** Our market isn’t like it used to be. Now, buyers have more options, so prices are much more flexible.&nbsp;

If you have questions about any of these four things, please call or email me. I am always willing to help\!
