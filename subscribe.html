<p>Dear Real Estate Agent:</p>

<p>Are you looking for training that teaches you exactly what you need to do to sell homes specifically right here in the Capital District?</p>

<p>I invite you to subscribe to our free real estate agent training newsletter.</p>

<p>Every month, we publish helpful tips for you. These include:
<ol class="indent">
<li>Real agent success stories</li>
<li>Question and answer videos</li>
<li>Highlights of our team training</li>
<li>Our favorite technology tips</li>
</ol></p>

<p>Our goal is to give you a taste of the training we provide if you have any interest in working with us in the future.</p>

<p>We have no intention of recruiting you - that’s a conversation with us when you are ready, if at all.</p>

<p>Last year, 29,604 homes were sold in the greater Capital District.</p>

<p>That’s plenty of business to go around for all of us.</p>

<p>We were fortunate to sell 973 homes last year. On average, our full-time agents earn six figures or more (a year) with us.</p>

<p>The same training, they get, will help you do it as well.</p>

<p>So, if you’re interested in knowing what we’re up to here, and you’d like to stay current on the latest strategies to:
<ol class="indent">
<li>Generate qualified seller leads</li>
<li>Attract buyers who actually want to buy</li>
<li>Convert more leads to appointments</li>
<li>Win more listing presentations at full commission</li>
<li>Systematize your administrative processes</li>
<li>Earn more referrals and reviews for repeat business</li>
</ol></p>


<p>…I invite you to subscribe to our free newsletter below.</p>

</div>
<p class="testimonial-text indent">"If there’s anybody that knows how to help you overcome business challenges, it’s Willie, whose journey literally started from the floor up. You can’t find a more authentic blend of humility and bold leadership than you can in this guy! Follow his guidance very closely, because he cares enough to share the truth and nothing but the truth!" <br><span class="testimonial-author">- Danny Griffin, Founder & CEO of Griffin Realty Group<br>Osterville, MA</span></p>


<div class="testimonial-image-container">

</div>
<p class="testimonial-text indent">"I learned a lot from Willie. His coaching not only helped me become the #1 Keller Williams Agent Worldwide but it also helped me fulfill my dreams of opening my own real estate brokerage in 2011 and ultimately becoming the #1 Residential Real Estate Team in Ottawa, Canada. Thank you, Willie!" <br><span class="testimonial-author">- Paul Rushforth, Broker/Owner of Paul Rushforth Real Estate, Inc. Brokerage <br>Ottawa, Canada</span></p>


<div class="testimonial-image-container">

</div>
<p class="testimonial-text indent">"Willie’s real estate systems flat out work! For years, I struggled to survive with only a handful of listings each year. I went from just 7 listings on my own, to 25, to now selling over 50 homes each year, following Willie’s systems. I now have a strong predictable business year in and year out. Thanks Willie!" <br><span class="testimonial-author">- John Stevens, Real Estate Broker<br>Watertown, NY</span></p>

<p>Most importantly, everything you receive is designed to start a conversation. So, if you have any questions about selling real estate you can email me at <a href="mailto:wmiranda@mrgteam.com">wmiranda@mrgteam.com</a>.</p>

<p>I’ll first answer your question by email, and if I think it would be of benefit to more people, I’ll answer it in a video.</p>

<p>We look forward to staying in touch. Let’s raise the standard and training of all real estate agents in the Capital District.</p>
