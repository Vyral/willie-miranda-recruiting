<li>Can my home be sold safely?</li>
<li>Are home prices dropping?</li>
<li>Is now a good time to sell?</li>
<li>Do I need to repair my home?</li>
<li>Will my home pass inspection?</li>
<li>What mistakes should I avoid?</li>
<li>How do I get rid of my “stuff”?</li>
<li>How do I attract buyers now?</li>
</ul></p>

<p>You'll learn 3 ways to add thousands of dollars to your home sale in an uncertain market and what repairs to make (or avoid).</p>
