Check out what Ryan Serhant has to say about the future of social media and the strategies for getting ahead in the real estate market.

Willie and his brother, Brian Miranda (General Manager/Associate Broker at Miranda Real Estate Group, Inc.), travel to NYC for the day to meet with Ryan Serhant, the star of Million Dollar Listing New York, and the author of “Sell It Like Serhant.”

Check out what Ryan has to say about the future of social media and the strategies for getting ahead in the real estate market.

Some of today’s takeaways include:


  There are a lot of things you cannot control, but how hard you work isn’t one of them. 
  Why “Personal Branding” is essential today to be successful in business.
  Everything you do is a choice.
  The person that cares the least holds the power.
