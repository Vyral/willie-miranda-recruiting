        <title>Why Do I Need a Notepad for Listing Appointments?</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/_JXcjRKoV5Y?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;center&gt;&lt;em&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s why you should always bring a notepad to listing appointments.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Today I want to impart the value of using a tool most real estate agents don’t even think about when going on listing appointments. &lt;strong&gt;It’s very simple: a notepad&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve been bringing a notepad to listing appointments for the past 15 years because early on, I learned the reason that I needed it the hard way. Years ago I lost a couple of listings, and when I called to follow up with them, the seller said they felt I didn’t seem very interested in the property. One client said that the agent they chose brought a notepad, a pen, and took notes on the updates we made to our home. When I walked through their house I was taking mental notes, but they couldn’t see that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So since that day, I’ve always brought a notepad to listing appointments. This is my advice to you: Take physical notes on any improvements the client has made to their property. Also, take either mental or physical notes about anything negative you notice about the home, then &lt;strong&gt;compliment them on the good things&lt;/strong&gt;, whether it’s a great lot, beautiful landscaping, attractive kitchen tile, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Make sure you don’t say things such as, “Who picked out the paint color in this room?” or “Wow, you’ll have to replace these carpets.” That’s no way to build a rapport in the first 15 minutes of meeting someone. Sellers are frequently emotional about their house, so they’re apprehensive and will take offense to unfavorable comments. Following this advice will help you win more listings.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>How Can You Stand Out in a Listing Appointment?</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/zwI4KZPKeuo?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;center&gt;&lt;em&gt;Our pre-listing packet sets us apart from other listing agents.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1:13 — &lt;strong&gt;No. 1&lt;/strong&gt;: A customized blue box or folder&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1:50 — &lt;strong&gt;No. 2&lt;/strong&gt;: A home seller’s guide&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2:42 — &lt;strong&gt;No. 3&lt;/strong&gt;: A “Meet the Team” booklet&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>5 Things I Wish I Knew Before Starting My Real Estate Career</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/LPdiU-WsDT4?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;center&gt;&lt;em&gt;Here are the five things I wish I&amp;rsquo;d known before diving into real estate.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Knowledge can be gained by anyone at any moment, but only time and experience can yield wisdom. When I look back on my career in real estate, there are five things in particular that I wish I’d known before jumping into the business. Most of these lessons I learned the hard way, but I’m sharing them in the hope that aspiring new agents can be spared the trial and error, and hit the ground running.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. Building a database&lt;/strong&gt;. I never knew how important it was to not only build a list of contacts but also regularly engage with those people. Today, we have an 18-step follow-up process so that our database receives something from us every month. As my database has grown over the years, so has my business.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. Buying more leads&lt;/strong&gt;. Whether you’re buying them on Zillow, Realtor.com, or UpNest, it’s so easy to buy leads these days. If you have the proper follow-up and have the right systems in place, those leads you buy today turn into business tomorrow and referrals after that. Buying leads allowed me to grow my database by bringing in new clientele while I strengthened the relationships I had already established.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. The importance of follow-ups&lt;/strong&gt;.  You’ve probably heard the saying, “The fortune’s in the follow-up,” and that couldn’t be more true; 80% of sales are made on the fifth to twelfth contact. I didn’t have those expectations at first, so I treated a lot of the leads from cold calling, open houses, or online like referrals. I’d call them once or twice, and if I didn’t hear back, well, I just figured they weren’t interested. Making sure you have a system in place to consistently follow-up on leads is so important.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4. Having a business plan&lt;/strong&gt;. Goals written down stand a better chance of becoming reality. I always tried to exceed what I did last year, but sitting down with a coach and projecting three, five, or even 10 years out (which can be hard to do) was so game-changing for me. It allowed me to wake up every day and know I was moving in a positive and specific direction. Make sure you have someone who holds you accountable to your business plan and encourages you so that you reach the next level.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5. Employee versus entrepreneur mindset&lt;/strong&gt;. We real estate agents are 1099 contractors—entrepreneurs at the helm of our own business. Coming into this business, however, I brought an employee mindset; many people would say to me, “The sky’s the limit, you can make as much as you want,” but what they never told me is that there’s no floor in real estate. If I were to do it all over again, I would’ve taken more time at the start to learn about entrepreneurship and what other successful business owners have done. I ultimately implemented a lot of great practices I learned directly from industry leaders and observed elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/home/?status=The fortune’s in the follow-up.%20http://localhost:4000/5-things-i-wish-i-knew-before-starting-my-real-estate-career.html%20via%40&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;pullquote&quot;&gt;“The fortune’s in the follow-up.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have any questions about this business or some of the tools, techniques, and systems that have made all the difference in my business, don’t hesitate to reach out to me via phone or email. I’d be more than happy to chat with you!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>How Can You Give Your Database a Boost?</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/SXM3U2d4mxg?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;center&gt;&lt;em&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s why agents&amp;rsquo; success is dependent on the growth of their databases.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just the other day, I was talking to an agent who has been in the business for more than 16 years and sold hundreds of homes. She mentioned seeing a decline in her activity over the past couple of years, especially in her repeat and referral business.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I asked what she uses for a CRM, and she said she didn’t have one. She admitted that, for one reason or another, all of her files are stored in a big cabinet down in her basement. “How are you communicating with your past clients?” I asked. She keeps some contacts on her phone and interacts with others via real estate. Others still just know to call her if they need real estate. That’s how she’s been operating for the past several years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is what I told her: My dentist sold his own business not too long ago, and it wasn’t his equipment or the fancy chair he had out in the lobby that made the sale possible. It was the relationship he had with his database. &lt;strong&gt;In real estate, your success or failure is directly tied to your database&lt;/strong&gt;. If your database is small and stagnant, your business will stay small and ultimately stagnate. However, when you start making efforts to grow your database, you’re bound to become more successful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I gave her a few tips on how she can grow her database, and the first one was obvious: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. Get a CRM&lt;/strong&gt;. You can get a free CRM at &lt;u&gt;&lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;http://www.hubspot.com&quot;&gt;hubspot.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/u&gt;. Their software is great and has an easy-to-use interface for your computer, tablet device, or phone. You can keep tabs on all of your contacts and mark follow-ups as needed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. Add five files every day&lt;/strong&gt;. Instead of tackling years of accrued files at one time, I recommended she just start small. For each file, list their name, number, email, and address. Reach out to them and let them know the market is doing really well right now; ask them, “Are you looking to make a move in 2020?” Whatever their answer is, document it on their file. Five files a day times five days a week equals 25 contacts. In four weeks, you’ll have more than 100 contacts. Once you reach 300 contacts, and correspond with them via market update videos, your business will start booming.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/home/?status=If your database is small and stagnant, your business will stay small and ultimately stagnate.%20http://localhost:4000/how-can-you-give-your-database-a-boost.html%20via%40&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;pullquote&quot;&gt;“If your database is small and stagnant, your business will stay small and ultimately stagnate.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As always, reach out to me via phone or email if you have questions about this or any other real estate-related topic. I look forward to hearing from you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/strategy-call/&quot;&gt;

        <title>How Can I Get My Goals Back on Track?</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/CmXJNr_tiGE?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;center&gt;&lt;em&gt;These three steps will ensure you achieve your goals for 2020.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, I’d like to say congratulations for making it through the first half of 2020; there were many bumps in the road. If you’re a bit off track for reaching your goals this year, I’m sharing the three steps for how to get back on pace to achieve them:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. Make a goal&lt;/strong&gt;. You need a clear, written goal; you can make a new one, or revise the ones you made in January. This goal could be to make more calls, reach out to your database more, develop a farm, create more videos, be more active on social media, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. Make a plan&lt;/strong&gt;. How many days per week will you work on this goal? What vacation time are you taking? What will it take, and what plans are you putting in place to reach your goal? Think through everything to ensure your plan can get you to your goal this year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. Take action&lt;/strong&gt;. This is the most critical step. You need to carry out the tasks necessary to achieve your goal. By changing a few activities daily, in just a few weeks you’ll begin to see progress.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/home/?status=You need a clear, written goal.%20http://localhost:4000/how-can-i-get-my-goals-back-on-track.html%20via%40&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;pullquote&quot;&gt;“You need a clear, written goal.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wish you the best in 2020. Don’t give up; even if you’re a little behind on your goals, don’t lower them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have questions about these steps or concerning real estate in general, please reach out via phone or email. I would be glad to help you.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>4 Lead Generation Tips every Real Estate Agent Should be Using</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/vA-B3TFbs7w?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Has lead generation been a challenge for you this year?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I recently spoke to a group of great agents in Florida that had some of the same challenges. &lt;strong&gt;Here are the four lead generation tips I shared with them:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Database&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Social Media&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Open Houses&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Geographic Farming&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These four simple activities are easy to implement and will generate &lt;u&gt;tons&lt;/u&gt; of leads for you in your business!&lt;/p&gt;
